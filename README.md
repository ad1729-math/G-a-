This is a beautiful number theoretical sequence, user Pruthviraj asked to prove some properties of this beautiful sum/sequence. Those were confirmed by mathematician Fedor Petrov and myself. I had found a formula for this sequence and thereby proving the properties. In this program I am using my formula to get the values of the sequence.
